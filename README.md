R tutorial on plotting/analyzing COVID-19 vaccination data by ZIP code in Texas.

0. Make a github account

1. Download GitHub Desktop
This is great if you are not familiar with git or how to use git on the command line. You can easily click buttons to push your changes to the master branch.

2. Download R https://www.r-project.org/
This may seem confusing because you must choose a "CRAN mirror" but just pick any of them. I typically go with "Revolution Analytics, Dallas, TX" because I am in TX.

3. Download R studio https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
This is an integrated development environemnt (IDE), so it's great for finding errors in real time and keeping you organized.

4. Clone this git repository (repo) and locate where the folder has been saved on your computer
Likely has been saved within a "GitHub" folder created by GitHub Desktop.

5. Open COVID_R_tutorial.Rproj
This should open with R studio.

6. Have fun! 
Learning is fun. Do not stress too hard if something isn't working. Google your errors and watch other tutorials while you are learning. R has a huge, global community and everyone started off learning something new. Sometimes a problem is weird and hard to figure out on your own, so ask your friends and teachers for help.
